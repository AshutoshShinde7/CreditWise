            <p>Credit cards are a popular way to make purchases, especially for people who don't have the money on hand to pay for an item. They're also useful for those who want to buy something but don't have enough time to save up the money before they need it--for example if you want a new laptop and know that it will take several months of saving up before you can afford it.</p>
            <p>The name "credit card" comes from their ability to give consumers access to credit (or borrowed funds), which allows them more flexibility when making purchases than cash would allow. Credit cards are issued by banks or other financial institutions and can be used at any location that accepts them as payment. </p>

                <li>Convenience in making payments online or in-store</li>
